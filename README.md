## Overview
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.
